        <h2 className="mb-1 text-lg font-semibold">Why RTD?</h2>
        <p>
          Ready-to-drink spirit mixes offer a simple, consistent way for people
          to enjoy long drinks and highballs without having to mix them at home.
          For retailers and importers, RTDs are easy to handle, easy to
          merchandise and well suited to e-commerce and convenience formats.

        <h2 className="mb-1 text-lg font-semibold">Formats and production</h2>
        <p>
          We typically work with 250 ml and 330 ml cans, using sensible outer
          pack formats for retail and for pallets. Recipes are developed with
          care, with clear labelling and straightforward designs that can be
          understood at a glance on shelf. Canning is handled by trusted
          production partners with experience in both soft drinks and alcohol
          lines.

          Own-label and exclusive ranges
        </h2>
        <p>
          As with our whisky work, we can create exclusive RTD ranges for a
          particular retailer or market. This can be under the retailer&apos;s
          own label or as a dedicated brand for that territory, designed to sit
          at a clear price point and offer good value against international
          competitors.

          Cocktails and serving suggestions
        </h2>
        <p>
          RTD cans are best served chilled, and many are at their best poured
          over ice. A Scotch-and-soda style mix can be served in a tall glass
          with ice and a twist of lemon. Whisky-and-ginger style mixes work well
          with ice and a slice of lime. Other spirit-based RTDs can be poured
          over ice with simple garnishes such as citrus, mint or seasonal fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also provide simple serve suggestions and point-of-sale
          material so that retailers and bar staff can show customers how best
          to enjoy the drinks without any fuss or complicated recipes.
